Cloud Networks enables customers to create and manage secure, isolated
networks in the cloud. 
These networks are fully single-tenant, and
customers have complete control over the network topology, 
IP addressing (IPv4 or IPv6), 
and which Cloud Servers are connected to the network.

.. TIP::
   Cloud Networks is part of the 
   core infrastructure of the Rackspace cloud, 
   the focus of this guide. 
   
   A good place to begin learning to interact with it is

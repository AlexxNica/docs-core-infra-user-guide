Introducing the Rackspace cloud
===============================
We want to help you confirm that working with Rackspace, home of
the #1 managed cloud, is the best way to get your work done.

The Rackspace public cloud is 
bigger than the core infrastructure 
that is the focus of this guide, 
but you are likely to begin with the core infrastructure and then add 
other products and services as you become increasingly familiar with 
what is possible in the cloud. 

* :ref:`core-infrastructure` summarizes the contribution 
  of each of the 
  cloud services in the core infrastructure.

* :ref:`context` identifies alternatives to the 
  OpenStack-based Rackspace public cloud, 
  all also based on OpenStack. 
  
* :ref:`cloud-tour` introduces additional cloud services that you may find 
  helpful in addition to the core infrastructure services.
  
* :ref:`customer-stories` suggests some of the ways in which 
  Rackspace customers have put the Rackspace cloud to work for them.

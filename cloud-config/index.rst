.. _cloud-config:

=====================================
Establishing your cloud configuration
=====================================
Use the Rackspace cloud core infrastructure services--Cloud Servers, Cloud Networks,
Cloud Images, Cloud Block Storage, and Cloud Files--to create the core of your cloud
configuration. After you've done that, take further action to make your cloud
configuration secure, recoverable, and manageable.

The core infrastructure services are grouped here
consistently with the categories introduced in
:ref:`cloud-tour`:

* :ref:`cloud-config-compute` discusses Cloud Servers
  and Cloud Images, introducing key concepts and basic actions
  for each.

* :ref:`cloud-config-network` discusses Cloud Networks,
  introducing key concepts and basic actions.

* :ref:`cloud-config-storage` discusses Cloud Block Storage and Cloud Files,
  introducing key concepts and basic actions.

Each service includes a *concepts* section, which introduces
ideas to help you understand how you can use that service to
optimize your cloud configuration, and an *actions* section that
introduces the things you can ask the service to do, such as listing
or creating or deleting virtual devices.

For details about how to accomplish
those actions using the interface of your choice, begin at
:ref:`cloud-interfaces`.

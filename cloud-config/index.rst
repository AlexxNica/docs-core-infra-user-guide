.. _cloud_config:

=====================================
Establishing your cloud configuration
=====================================
Use our core infrastructure services--Cloud Servers, Cloud Networks,
Cloud Images, Cloud Block Storage--to create the core of your cloud
configuration. After you've done that, take further action to make your cloud
configuration secure, recoverable, and manageable.

The core infrastructure services are grouped here 
consistently with the categories introduced in 
:ref:`cloud-tour`:

* :ref:`cloud-config-compute` discusses Cloud Servers 
  and Cloud Images, introducing key concepts and basic actions
  for each. 
  
* :ref:`cloud-config-network` discusses Cloud Networks, 
  introducing key concepts and basic actions.  
  
* :ref:`cloud-config-storage` discusses Cloud Block Storage, 
  introducing key concepts and basic actions.  
  
For each service, the concepts section introduces ideas to 
help you understand what aspects of your cloud configuration 
the service can help with; the actions section introduces specific 
things you can ask the service to do, such as listing or creating or 
deleting virtual devices. For details about how to accomplish 
those actions using the interface of your choice, begin at 
:ref:`cloud_interfaces`.

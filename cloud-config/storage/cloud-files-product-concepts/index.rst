Understanding Cloud Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Rackspace Cloud Files storage system provides a secure,
network-accessible way to store an unlimited number of files. Each file
can be as large as 5 gigabytes. You can store as much as you want
and only pay for the storage space you actually use.

Cloud Files also provides a simple yet powerful way to publish and
distribute content behind a content delivery network (CDN). As a
Cloud Files user, you get access to this network automatically.

Cloud Files enables you to store and retrieve files and CDN-enabled
content through a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) web
services interface. There are also language-specific APIs that use the
RESTful API and make it easy for integration into your applications.

Ideal Uses for Cloud Files

The Cloud Files service is an excellent storage solution for a number
of scenarios and is well suited to numerous applications.

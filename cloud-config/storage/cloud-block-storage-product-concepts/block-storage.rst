Block storage for cloud servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using Cloud Block Storage, you can add disk space to your cloud
servers by attaching storage volumes.

Cloud Block Storage offers volumes in the following flavors:

* Standard (spinning hard disk, or SATA)

* High-performance (SSD)

Standard (SATA) volumes are suitable for customers who need traditional
high-capacity storage at a low price. SSD volumes are suitable for
customers who intend to run databases or other highly transactional or
high-I/O applications in the cloud.

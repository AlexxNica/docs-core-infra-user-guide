Create a Container
''''''''''''''''''
Before uploading any data to Cloud Files, you must create a storage
container. Containers cannot be created within another container, however
you can create up to 500,000 containers in your Cloud Files
account. Each container can store an unlimited number of objects.

Delete a Container
''''''''''''''''''
All objects within a container must be deleted before the container
itself can be deleted. Multiple containers allow for better
threading of the deletion scrips.

Deleting a container is a permanent action and cannot be reversed.

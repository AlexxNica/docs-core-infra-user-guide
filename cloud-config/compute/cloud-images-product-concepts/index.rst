Understanding Cloud Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A virtual machine image ("image") is a single file that
contains a virtual disk that contains a bootable operating system.

Images come in several formats. The Rackspace Managed Cloud uses
images in the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) format. The VHD format was
developed by Microsoft and is used by the Microsoft Hyper-V and Citrix
XenServer hypervisors, among others.

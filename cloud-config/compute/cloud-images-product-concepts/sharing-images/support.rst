Getting support for shared images
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Rackspace supports the images that we offer as base images.

In almost all cases, an image that is shared from a producer to
consumers is one that has been modified from a base Rackspace image or
is a custom image that has been imported.

This means that providing detailed support for modifications or
applications in the shared image may be beyond the scope of Rackspace
support (in either Managed Infrastructure or Managed Operations).
Rackspace may be able to help you verify whether any
Cloud Servers created from the images have problems booting or other
issues, but detailed troubleshooting of any specific additional
functionality is the responsibility of the image producer.

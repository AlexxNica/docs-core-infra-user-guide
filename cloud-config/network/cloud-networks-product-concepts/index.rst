Understanding Cloud Networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Your cloud server configuration can include several kinds of networks,
connected as appropriate for your needs.

Using Cloud Networks, you can connect
virtual cloud servers
with
:ref:`other virtual cloud servers <network-cloud-servers>`,
with
:ref:`OnMetal cloud servers <network-onmetal-servers>`,
and, by using
:ref:`RackConnect <network-rackconnect>`,
with dedicated servers operating outside the cloud.

You can manage the networking capabilities of your cloud servers
in many of the same ways you manage your other networks,
including
:ref:`PublicNet <publicnet>`,
:ref:`ServiceNet <servicenet>`,
:ref:`DNS <dns>`,
and
:ref:`security groups <security-groups>`.

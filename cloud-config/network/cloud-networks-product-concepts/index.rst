Understanding Cloud Networks
============================
Your cloud server configuration can include several kinds of networks,
connected as appropriate for your needs.

Using Cloud Networks, you can connect 
virtual cloud servers with other virtual cloud servers, 
with OnMetal cloud servers, 
and, with RackConnect, 
with dedicated servers operating outside the cloud.

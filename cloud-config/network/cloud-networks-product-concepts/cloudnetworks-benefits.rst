Customer benefits from Cloud Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are some of the ways in which Cloud Networks can 
be useful within your Cloud Servers configuration: 

* **Isolate your servers**

    You can create Cloud Servers without public or 
    private (ServiceNet) network interfaces, 
    making them accessible only through Cloud Networks.

* **Support clustering** 

    You can take advantage of full support 
    for broadcasting and multicasting as 
    required for some clustering technologies.

* **Simplify network changes**

    You can make networking changes to existing deployments 
    without having to rebuild your cloud server.

* **Automate network changes**

    Via the Cloud Networks API, 
    you can develop custom software to automatically 
    create networks and attach or detach Cloud Servers 
    based on workload requirements.

* **Support complex topologies**

    You can combine Cloud Networks with 
    `Brocade Vyatta Routers <http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/vrouter/>`__ 
    to create complex topologies that route traffic 
    between Cloud Networks or to external data centers over VPN.

* **Scale networks as you grow** 

    Up to 250 Cloud Servers can be attached to a single cloud network.
    You can have up to 10 cloud networks per region.

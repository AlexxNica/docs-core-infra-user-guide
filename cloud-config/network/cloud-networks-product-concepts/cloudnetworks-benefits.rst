Customer benefits from Cloud Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are some of the ways in which Cloud Networks can
be useful within your Cloud Servers configuration:

* **Isolate your servers**

    You can create servers without public or
    private (ServiceNet) network interfaces,
    making them accessible only through Cloud Networks.

* **Support clustering**

    Cloud Networks includes full support
    for broadcasting and multicasting as
    required for some clustering technologies.

* **Simplify network changes**

    You can make networking changes to existing deployments
    without having to rebuild your server.

* **Automate network changes**

    Via the Cloud Networks API,
    you can develop custom software to automatically
    create networks and attach or detach servers
    based on workload requirements.

* **Support complex topologies**

    You can combine Cloud Networks with
    :rax-cloud:`Brocade Vyatta Routers <servers/vrouter/>`
    to create complex topologies that route traffic
    between cloud networks or to external data centers over VPN.

* **Scale networks as you grow**

    You can attach up to 250 servers to a single cloud network.
    You can have up to 10 cloud networks per region.

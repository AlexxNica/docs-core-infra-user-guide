A security group is a named container for security group rules. 
Security group rules provide Rackspace Public Cloud users the ability 
to specify the types of traffic that are allowed to pass 
through, to, and from ports 
(Public/ServiceNet) 
on a cloud server. 

Security groups are not yet available through the Cloud Control Panel.
To work with security groups now, 
use the 
:ref:`neutron CLI <neutron>`
or 
:ref:`Cloud Networks API <cloudnetworks-api>`.

To learn more about security groups, read
:kc-faq:`Security groups FAQ <security-groups-faq>` and
:rax-docs:`Use security groups to control traffic <networks/api/v2/cn-gettingstarted/content/security_groups.html>`.

=======================
Succeeding in the cloud
=======================
Creating a Cloud Servers configuration and equipping it with appropriate
security, backup, application software, monitoring, and scaling can
be a one-time experience, if you like what you build the first time and
want to stick with it.

Even if you don't need to change your configuration,
you should expect to interact with Rackspace occasionally,
probably by logging into your
:mycloud:`Cloud Control Panel <>`,
to maintain your contact
information, to assign specific roles to specific users, to see or
change your billing options, and to explore new services and features.

To learn about some of the basic activities you may
need to perform in the Cloud Control Panel, begin with
:kc:`Getting Started with Cloud Servers <getting-started/cloud-servers>`.

In the Rackspace cloud,
you can quickly try something, decide it isn't quite right for you,
then try something else. It's a flexible, reliable environment, but
there are some limits,
some practices are more productive than others,
trouble can happen,
and
you may sometimes need help.

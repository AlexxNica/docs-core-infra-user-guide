Succeeding in the managed cloud
===============================
Creating a Cloud Servers configuration and equipping it with appropriate
security, backup, application software, monitoring, and scaling can
be a one-time experience, if you like what you build the first time and
want to stick with it.

Beyond the setup process, you should expect to interact with Rackspace,
probably by logging into your `Cloud Control
Panel <https://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`__, to maintain your contact
information, to assign specific roles to specific users, to see or
change your billing options, and to enable services in addition to the
core infrastructure. To learn about some of the the activities you may
need to perform, start at

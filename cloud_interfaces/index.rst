Interacting with the cloud
==========================
One of the benefits of having an open standards based cloud, designed for
consistency and ease of use, is that there are multiple ways to interact with
and manage your cloud resources.

Depending on your needs, you may prefer a web based control panel, software
integration with your current applications and workflows, or shell scripting. In
almost all cases, the functionality available is going to be similar, so it
comes down to a personal choice or business needs.

The Rackspace Cloud provides OpenStack-based Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs) for all of its management functionality. These APIs are actually what
power the Cloud Control Panel, the Command Line Interfaces, and Software
Development Kits (as well as providing powerful raw API access). Each of these
interfaces take the OpenStack APIs and provide the best user or developer
experience for each situation.

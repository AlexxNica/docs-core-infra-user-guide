Interacting with the cloud
==========================
One of the benefits of having a cloud based on open standards, 
designed for
consistency and ease of use, 
is that there are multiple ways to interact with
and manage your cloud resources.

Depending on your needs, 
you may prefer to interact with the cloud through 
a web-based control panel, 
software
integration with your current applications and workflows, 
or shell scripting. 
In almost all cases, 
the functionality available is, 
so you can choose an interface
based on personal preference or business needs.

The Rackspace cloud provides 
OpenStack-based Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs) for all of its management functionality. 
These APIs are actually what
power the Cloud Control Panel, the Command Line Interfaces (CLIs), 
and Software
Development Kits (SDKs). 
Each of these
interfaces take the OpenStack APIs and provide the best user or developer
experience for each situation.
The APIs themselves 
also provide direct programmatic access to cloud services.

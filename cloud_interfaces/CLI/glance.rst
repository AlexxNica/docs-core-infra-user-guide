The OpenStack tool primarily used for 
managing Cloud Images is written
in Python and called *glance*. 
It is also known as 
*python-glanceclient*.

We recommend that you use the 
`Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__ 
to install glanceclient, as it will handle installing dependencies and
required packages for you.

Alternatively, you can download the rackspace-glanceclient package from 
https://github.com/rackerlabs/rackspace-glanceclient.

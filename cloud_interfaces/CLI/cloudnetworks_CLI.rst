Cloud Networks and CLIs: nova and supernova
-------------------------------------------
To interact with Cloud Networks at the command line, 
you can use tools created specifically for the purpose 
of interacting with OpenStack-based clouds 
(nova, supernova) 
or general-purpose tools (cURL). 

Because Cloud Servers and Cloud Networks work so 
closely together, 
the command-line tools that work well with Cloud Servers 
also work well with Cloud Networks. 

You can read about these as a group at 
:ref:`cloudservers_CLI` 
or individually:

* :ref:`nova`
* :ref:`supernova`
* :ref:`curl`

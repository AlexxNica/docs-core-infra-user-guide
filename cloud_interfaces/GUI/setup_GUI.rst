Preparing to use the Cloud Control Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel, you need:

* a Web browser
* a Rackspace account
* credentials (username and password) giving you access 
  to that account 
  
Login by launching the browser, opening https://mycloud.rackspace.com/, 
filling in your credientials, and clicking **Log In**.

The account's credentials are those that were chosen when you, 
or someone else at your account, created a Rackspace 
cloud account.

If you do not have a Rackspace cloud account, 
or if you have forgotten the account's credentials, 
you can use links from the Cloud Control Panel's login page 
to get what you need.

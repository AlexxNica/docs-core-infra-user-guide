GUI: Rackspace Cloud Control Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Rackspace Cloud Control Panel at https://mycloud.rackspace.com is
the easiest way to get started with provisioning cloud resources.

The Cloud Control Panel provides a simple, unified web based interface
that works in all major browsers. After signing up for a Cloud account
at rackspace.com, the Cloud Control panel is the first place you will
generally visit to get an overview of products and services available,
create your first servers and resources, or view more information about
your Rackspace account.

The Cloud Control Panel is also where you can complete some important
first tasks:

-  obtain your API keys for use with SDKs, Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
   and direct API usage

-  create additional account users and give them permissions if needed

-  view and change resource limits

The Cloud Control Panel may be the only interface needed by many users,
especially if you donâ€™t need to heavily automate the management of your
cloud resources.

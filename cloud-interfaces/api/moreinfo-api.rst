Learning more about SDKs and APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rackspace continuously improves
the SDKs and APIs we support.
We publish release notes to
announce new features, bug fixes, and other changes.

Watch for release notes announcing changes to the SDKs :rax-dev:`here <sdks>`.
You can subscribe to
an Atom feed for each SDK's release notes
so you are notified when we update them.

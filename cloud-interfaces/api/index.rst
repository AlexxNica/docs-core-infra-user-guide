API and SDK: Developer and DevOps tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you write applications that are tightly integrated with
the Rackspace cloud
you may find that
clicking to choose options in the Cloud Control Panel
and typing to issue commands with CLIs
are not ideal for
your purposes.

If you develop or distribute applications for your customers,
or if you wish to heavily automate operation of your
cloud infrastructure,
you may need to interact with cloud services
through one of the many available Software Development Kits
or by
direct API access.

If you are responsible for administering systems that are
used for cloud software development,
you may want to investigate DevOps tools
designed for this purpose.

.. _cloudfiles-cli:

---------------------------
Cloud Files and CLIs: swift
---------------------------

To interact with Cloud Files at the command line, you can use tools
created specifically for the purpose of interacting with OpenStack-based
clouds (nova, swift) or general-purpose tools (cURL).

Because Cloud Servers and Cloud Files work so closely together,
the command-line tools that work well with Cloud Servers also
work well with Cloud Files.

You can read about these as a group at :ref`cloudservers-cli`
or you can go directly to the tool that interests you:

* :ref:`nova`
* :ref:`supernova`
* :ref:`curl`

You can also use the :ref:`swift`, focused on Cloud Files.

In working with Cloud Files, you may find that you need to use
nova for some functions and swift for others. You should install
them both.

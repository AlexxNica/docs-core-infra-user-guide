Rackspace CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rackspace Command Line Interface(rack) is a unified tool you can use tomanage your Rackspace
services.

As opposed to using different clients to perform different tasks, Rack CLI requires
no additional plugins to allow additional functionality with the Rackspace Cloud.
Rackspace CLI utilizes `gophercloud <http://gophercloud.io/>`__, an Openstack
compatible SDK that allows for complete functionality with most Rackspace services.

.. note::

    Rackspace CLI is currently in beta. Therefore, some services and configurations
    may not be supported at this time.

Follow the `installation and configuration <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/rack-cli/configuration/>`__
instructions from the Rackspace CLI user guide to use Rackspace CLI.

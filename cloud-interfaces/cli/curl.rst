cURL CLI
++++++++
`cURL <http://curl.haxx.se/>`__
is a general-purpose command-line tool
for interacting with REST APIs.
Using cURL to submit a single request at the command line is
a common method of experimenting with an API before deciding
whether to write software to automate that request,
so
:rax-docs:`Rackspace's API documentation <>`
includes
many cURL-based examples.

You can read basic information about cURL
in several Rackspace publications,
including:

* :rax-docs:`How cURL commands work <servers/api/v2/cn-gettingstarted/content/curl.html>`
* :kc-article:`Cloud Files cURL Cookbook <cloud-files-curl-cookbook>`
* :rax-docs:`Authenticate with cURL <servers/api/v2/cs-gettingstarted/content/curl_auth.html>`

At the
:rax-dev:`Developer Center <>`,
you can see examples of using cURL to
send requests to the API endpoints
for many Rackspace cloud services.
A shell is a program that emulates a terminal,
enabling you to type commands and observe responses;
`bash <http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`__
is a widely-used shell.

At the
:rax-dev:`Developer Center <>`,
if you select
**Shell** as your preferred language,
you will see samples formatted for use at the command line
with
cURL.

You can use any tool that enables you to type a command, send it
as a request to a REST API's endpoint,
and then examine the API's response.

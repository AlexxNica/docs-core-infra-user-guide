**Assumptions**
---------------
We wrote this guide for you, imagining "you" as someone who

-  | is already a Rackspace customer
   | *We want to help you understand what's available to you in the
     Rackspace managed cloud; you may already be familiar with other
     Rackspace products and services.
     *

-  knows quite a lot about your own application

   *We want to show you how your new managed cloud configuration can
   give you new ways to get your work done; you've already decided what
   that work is.
   *

-  | works confidently with computing outside the cloud
   | *We haven't written an introduction to computing; if we use a term
     and don't define it, that's because we're using it in an
     industry-standard way that we imagine is clear to you. For a few
     key ideas that we aren't sure every version of "you" has met
     before, we've included definitions at* Terminology\ *.*

-  | knows a little about cloud computing and now wants to know a lot
     about cloud computing at Rackspace
   | *We'll explain key ideas and how they relate to each other; your
     situation is unique, and we want to help you recognize topics to
     investigate and options to pursue and as you move your work into
     the Rackspace managed cloud.
     *

-  | is willing to follow links from this brief guide to more detailed
     Rackspace resources
   | *We'll point you toward case studies, step-by-step tutorials, API
     references, community discussions, and more; as you get started in
     the Rackspace managed cloud, learning to use supporting information
     will help you become confident and successful.*

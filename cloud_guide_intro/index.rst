How to use this guide
=====================
We created this guide to help you get the most from your Rackspace cloud 
and especially from its core infrastructure:

* Cloud Servers

* Cloud Networks

* Cloud Images

* Cloud Block Storage

The guide doesn't replace our detailed technical documentation, but we
hope it simplifies your startup process and gives you a clear picture of
what, after getting started, you can do in the Rackspace cloud.

* **Introducing the Rackspace cloud**
   provides a high-level overview of our core infrastructure, 
   explains how our cloud hosting differs from other kinds of hosting,  
   gives a brief tour of Rackspace cloud services,  
   and connects you to our collection of user stories.
 
* **Interacting with the cloud** suggests several ways of
   controlling your configuration, including the GUI-based Cloud Control
   Panel and several CLIs, APIs, and SDKs.
 
* **Establishing your cloud configuration**, focusing on the core
   infrastructure, provides facts and suggestions to help you quickly
   establish a useful and manageable cloud configuration.
 
* **Preparing for productivity** specifies pre-production steps you should
   take to harden your Cloud Server and make it ready for work.
 
* **Succeeding in the cloud** identifies ongoing
   responsibilities and suggests special-interest topics that may
   interest you after you are established in the cloud.

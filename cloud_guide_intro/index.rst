\f0\fs24 \cf0 How to use this guide\
=====================\
We created this guide to help you get the most from your Rackspace\
managed cloud and especially from its core infrastructure:\
\
-   Cloud Servers\
\
-   Cloud Networks\
\
-   Cloud Images\
\
-   Cloud Block Storage\
\
The guide doesn't replace our detailed technical documentation, but we\
hope it simplifies your startup process and gives you a clear picture of\
what, after getting started, you can do in the Rackspace cloud. \
\
-   **Introducing the Rackspace cloud** \
    provides a high-level overview of our core infrastructure, \
    explains how our cloud hosting differs from other kinds of hosting, \
    gives a brief tour of Rackspace cloud services, \
    and connects you to our collection of user stories.\
\
-   **Interacting with the cloud** \
    suggests several ways of controlling your configuration, \
    including the GUI-based Cloud Control Panel \
    and several CLIs, APIs, and SDKs.\
\
-   **Establishing your cloud configuration**, \
    focusing on the core\
    infrastructure, provides facts and suggestions to help you quickly\
    establish a useful and manageable cloud configuration.\
\
-   **Preparing for productivity** specifies pre-production \
    steps you  should take to harden your Cloud Server \
    and make it ready for work.\
\
-   **Succeeding in the managed cloud** identifies ongoing\
    responsibilities and suggests special-interest topics that may\
    interest you after you are established in the managed cloud.\

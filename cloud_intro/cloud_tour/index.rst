Touring the managed cloud, service by service
---------------------------------------------
The managed cloud is more than a virtualized representation of physical
computing resources, but thinking of it that way may help you understand
how so many different services combine to support your workload. Just as
if you had a fixed configuration of physical computing equipment, the
services that provide you with flexible computing in the cloud must
deliver processing power (Cloud Servers) in reusable patterns (Cloud
Images), connectable as an internal network (Cloud Networks) and
expandable to large storage sizes (Cloud Block Storage). We consider
these four services to be the core infrastructure of our managed cloud;
the core infrastructure is the focus of this guide.

Other services provide additional functions such as authentication
(Cloud Identity), recoverability (Cloud Backup), long-term storage
(Cloud Files) and databases (Cloud Databases, Cloud Big Data, Object
Rocket), connections to public-facing networks (Cloud CDN, Cloud DNS,
Cloud Load Balancers) and dedicated hardware (RackConnect), observation
of activity (Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Metrics, Cloud Feeds), and
automated installation (Cloud Orchestration) and reconfiguration (Auto
Scale). These services work well with the core infrastructure and with
each other. They are not the primary focus of this guide, but we'll
mention them when they are relevant.

In other Rackspace resources such as the 
`Cloud Control Panel <https://mycloud.rackspace.com/>`__
and the 
`Knowledge Center <http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/>`__,
you should notice that Rackspace cloud products
are grouped so that closely-related products are likely to be discussed together. 
We follow that convention here, introducing several categories of cloud products 
available as services in the Rackspace cloud.

Rackspace cloud core infrastructure at a glance
---------------------------------------------
Your Rackspace cloud configuration is backed by the physical
infrastructure in our data centers; read more about Rackspace data
centers at http://www.rackspace.com/about/datacenters.

The virtual infrastructure of the managed cloud is provided by
infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) software services that perform some
of the same functions as hardware devices in our data centers:

* Cloud Servers provides computing power.

* Cloud Networks creates an internal network of Cloud Servers.

* Cloud Block Storage emulates a removable disk, which can be
   transferred from one Cloud Server to another.

* Cloud Images preserves a consistent starting point for new Cloud
   Server instances.

* Additional services enable specific activities such as user
   authentication, load balancing, and event monitoring.

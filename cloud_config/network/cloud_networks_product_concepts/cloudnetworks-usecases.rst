~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Typical use cases for Cloud Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cloud Networks is especially useful for 
tightening security, increasing flexibility, 
and maintaining uninterrupted availability. 

**Security**

  Get fully isolated, single-tenant Layer 2 networks designed to securely
  transfer sensitive information between Cloud Servers located in the same
  region.

**Flexibility and control**

  Control IP addressing (IPv4 or IPv6) and topology to create networks
  that suit your workload. For example, 
  you can create one network between web servers and
  app servers, 
  and another network between app servers and database servers.

**High availability**

  Because multiple Cloud Servers can share the same IP address, you can
  use fast IP address failover to enable high availability without making
  a separate API call.
